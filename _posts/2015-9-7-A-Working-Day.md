title: He's got his own blog.

Hey, everyone! After much prolonging, I've finally decided to give 
[blogging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP_0cfW2dKo) a try. 


My vision for the site is to emphasize unity across disciplines. Often times 
that includes making conjectures about what themes underlie seemingly disparate
ideas, and seeing if we can simplify and consolidate our knowledge in more
effective ways. This is inherently a top-down process, one that claims that there
are no such things as isolated facts. My rationale is simple: every fact talks
*about* something, a concept. These concepts, in turn, depend upon a framework,
or theory, for their intelligibility. Without such theories (and their motivating
assumptions), there would be no such thing as "understanding." This isn't to say
that the physical mechanisms within the brain (or any other system) are inherently
bottom-up...they're most likely not. However, I do think that reasoning in its 
general form is naturally biased towards a top-down approach. And so, given my 
interests in higher-order phenomena, I shall stick to theorizing.


With that said, this isn't an academic or professional blog; I will make 
occasional posts about music, literature, or whatever else captures my attention.
This goes back to my previous point: it's not just the topics themselves that are
relevant, but rather the form each post takes and their relationship to other
posts. I might experiment with my presentation style to see what works. 


Now, if you *are* interested in the content and not just the pretty shapes
words make, here's all I can tell you: it's a secret so shhh. I'm aiming for
surprise without a ton of anxious unpredicability. We'll see. 

Until we meet again~
